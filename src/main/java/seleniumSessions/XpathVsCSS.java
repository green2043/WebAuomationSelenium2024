		//Synatx: CSS is easy
		//text: xpat,  CSS doesn't support
		//contains/startswith/endswith: Both (endswith doesn't support by xpath0
		//contains+text+attribute: xpath
		//backward traversing: xpath,  CSS doesn't support
		//siblings: xpath
		//dynamic element: both (e.g: class='test_4654dg64')
		//comma: css
		//indexing: xpath is better
		//performance:both
		    /* EXLANATION:
		     Earlier xpath was very slow like around 10yrs back in Internet explorer browser, It had very poor xpath engine,
		     Nowadays xpath engines are super fast, more advanced. Different browser has different xpath engine.
		     CSS doesn't have engine,it's a  common format for web application.
